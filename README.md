# Skincare & Beauty E Commerce Analysis - F 20 P Analytics Challenge September 

## Project Background 

Task was to  create a comprehensive Power BI report using an order dataset from a global skincare and beauty e-store. Your report should analyze sales volumes and profitability across various product groups and markets, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) critical to the e-store's success. Specifically, the e-store aims to achieve an average annual profit margin of 15% across all product groups, 20% annual overall sales growth with a higher target of 30% for the corporate segment, and at least $400K in annual sales for each market. The final report should not only visualize these KPIs but also provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making for the e-store's future growth.
